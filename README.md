# Cheatsheets Tool

## Purpose
A quick and dirty cheatsheet utility because my small brain can never remember all the switches/flags, commands, etc with all the various tools that I use.

Feel free to steal it, make it better, whatever.

## USAGE

From terminal type:
`$ cheat <keyword>`

where `<keyword>` is vim, tmux, bash, or anything else you might have a cheatsheet for

## INSTRUCTIONS

1) make the `cheat` script executable (`chmod +x cheat.sh`) and put it in the bin folder (`user/local/bin` probably being the most appropriate)
2) make sure bin is in your path (user/local/bin already in path on osx by default)
3) run via calling the name of the script (eg `cheat tmux`)
