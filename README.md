# Cheatsheets Utility

#### Purpose
Custom cheat cheat utility that allows you to easily reference custom cheatsheets while working in terminal.

#### Usage

Just download the script and put it in your bin folder as an executable.

Then you can type `cheat <keyword>` where `<keyword>` is the topic of the cheatsheet (ie vim, tmux, etc)

Eg. `cheat vim` or `cheat tmux`, etc
